But John's dream was not realistic. He expected perfection on his very first try. Naturally  You say you're tired and I understand Cause you're my woman and I'm your man I'll always wait with you Always unsure of what to do  They scream from the towers, sit back and relax I listen closely, but can't repeat their acts Is that the prize of a good life, then that's what I'll say So darling for you I'm gonna change my ways  You say you're tired and I understand Cause you're my woman and I'm your man I'll always wait with you Always unsure of what to do  ...so disappointed that he suffered an emotional upset.
