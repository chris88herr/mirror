 Oh, all this time I was just running around A beautiful mind between those eyes I wasn’t looking, but oh I found A gap in the clouds, the sun comes out We’ll stay up all night make you feel alright Oh life, oh life  Oh my dear, don’t be afraid Oh my hearts been cold But it could come back to life someday Who really knows the truth? Life’s what you make it And I wanna make it with you Oh you, oh you, oh-oh  Oh, all this time I was just running around A beautiful mind between those eyes I wasn’t looking, but oh I found A gap in the clouds, the sun comes out We’ll stay up all night make you feel alright Oh life, oh life  Oh, I’ve been dancing for quite a while It’s cold out but those blue eyes and smile Oh, that smile  Oh, all this time I was just running around A beautiful mind between those eyes I wasn’t looking, but oh I found A gap in the clouds and the sun comes out We’ll stay up all night make you feel alright Oh life, oh life
