 This Is the real action, the Pot Party The trippers, the grasshoppers, the hip ones All gathered in secrecy And flying high as a kite Outside the boundaries of their "phony" world of kicks Is the ever present possibility of discovery This time the gang's lucky It's not the law, or discovery, or problems It's just their supplier, Pete, with his number one chick And a new guy looking for kicks Forget it man and get with the countdown Shake this square world and blast off for Kicksville
