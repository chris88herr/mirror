John surrenders his dignity and lays his future on the chopping block Not whether it's good or bad or right or wrong But if he stopped to think He would see the stupidy of it all Now he's too involved to think He's having kicks He's away and flying Up, up, out of this world But everything that goes up must come down When John came down he landed with a thud Due to the effects of the alcohol and the late hours at the party The following day he was too tired, too sick Now facing another day He finds the same problems The same responsibilities
