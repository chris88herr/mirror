Cause you are nothing that I can't get over Cause you are nothing that I can't get over So I'll right my wrongs I'll undo all of my wrongs But oh your name still keeps coming up in all of my songs And I'll put it down to poetic license as I cry My own demise since you left Another pair of eyes pierce my soul Oh but they'll always let me go But I'll try before they can help me I- To push them away I'll be by myself Cause you are nothing that I can't get over Cause you are nothing that I can't get over No, no, no, no, no, no yeah You are nothing You'll be my everything for about two weeks Cause you, oh you are nothing that I can't get over No, no, no Nothing that I can't get over
