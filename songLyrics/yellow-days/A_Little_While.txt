It's just for a little while, and then it burns away..."  Broken by love This hurt divides itself Decided that kissing you is just bad for my health  So I'm gonna ride I'm going the other way I would've told you why If there was any space for me To say, to say  Oh don't you see it now? I'm staying for a little while Oh don't you see it now?

I'm staying for a little while Oh don't you see it now? I'm staying for a little while  So I'm gonna ride I'm going the other way I would've told you why If there was any space for me To say, to say  Oh don't you see it now? I'm staying for a little while Oh don't you see it now? I'm staying for a little while
