 "We can do all kinds of physical things, trying to find that peace that the world is seeking. But it will still be elusive, because everything that is physical is transitory. And the only thing that is not transitory in man is his own soul."  I try to see between the lines I try not to keep the spirit confined Let it feel sunshine It turns out the sun's gone and I don't know what is going on here  I've, I've been trapped in my, my own mind No escape I can find No I can't let go (Yeah, ooh)  I... I've been thinking too hard I was lost from the start That's a great to-be mood I... I've been thinking too hard It's a dangerous part that I've been to, yeah  I, I don't know what's right anymore The sea flooded and the rain poured I'm conditioned to survive Just I need to be alive I've got intuition on my side Just to ease that paranoid mind I've cried tears ocean-wide Just to ease that pain inside (ohh, yeah)  I... I've been thinking too hard I was lost from the start That's a great to-be mood I... I've been thinking too hard It's a dangerous part that I've been to, yeah  "Now, you see if you want to live in a way that always is saying, "I think that life is disgusting." Supposing you want to deny being, or that, uh, people who, um, like music, are just a bunch of idiots, who sit around and go out of their minds listening to a lot of complicated noises. See there's always a way of talking about something to make it sound terrible. Equally, there is a way of talking about something to make it sound great. Now what do you want to do? Do you want to live your life in such a way that you're always saying to it, "hmm, hmm... yeah," you know? Do you want to- is that a good way to conduct things? Or do you want to live your life in such a way that you, you, you say, "C'mon, let's go!" You see? "Let- let's, let's... let's swing this thing!""
