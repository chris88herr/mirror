 How can I love you when you don't talk to me? Well, how can I breathe with no air? Well, I can only see what's in front of me But what's there is more than what I thought, baby  Well, in the evening sky I cast my eye with you on my mind And if the stars could speak They'd tell me to sleep to see you in my dreams Well, in the evening sky I cast my eye, it's a beautiful view Well, I'm lost again with thoughts of you  If only life had more colors I could see Well, life would be balanced It's hard to conceive it Well, it don't matter There's a window this evening Far and wide You keep texting me  When we're feeling good, everything's okay And when we're feeling down, there ain't nothing to say  Well, in the evening sky I cast my eye with you on my mind And if the stars could speak They'd tell me to sleep to see you in my dreams Well, in the evening sky I cast my eye, it's a beautiful view Well, I'm lost again with thoughts of you  If there's reality Patience please be kind to me Treat me like you know nothing As if ain't no history You can see the pain, see thing from words I speak And I take it very seriously  Well, in the evening sky I cast my eye with you on my mind And if the stars could speak They'd tell me to sleep to see you in my dreams Well, in the evening sky I cast my eye, it's a beautiful view Well, I'm lost again with thoughts of you  Thoughts of you, thoughts of you On my mind, on my mind Thoughts of you, thoughts of you On my mind, on my mind Thoughts of you, thoughts of you On my mind, on my mind Thoughts of you, thoughts of you On my mind, on my mind
