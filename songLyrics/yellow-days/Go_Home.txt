 As I stand outside your door I never wanted you more I adore everything you've done and more Oh, I won't be seeds of compromise As I look in those eyes, I realize I should really go home  I should really go home I should really go Home I should really go home  Take a swim through all your Thoughts and dreams and all you see I'm what got lost at the sea Cause oh there's no way I could show Just how you let me down Oh how you let me down Oh I won't be seeds of compromise And oh I realize, I-I... I should really go home  I should really go home I should really go home (Go home!) I should really go home I should really go home I should really go Home  I know you're scared So terrified Of your own mind But all I would say There's nothing to be scared of babe Oh  I should really go home (I should really go home) I should really go home I should really go home I should really go Home  I should really go home
