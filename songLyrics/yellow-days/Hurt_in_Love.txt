As I lay in the confines of my own mind And the cracks I find I wonder if I wasted your time bringing you here I watched the flood of your crystal clear tears As they slipped from your eyes As I slipped from your mind Oh my, to be hurt in love Well darling, that's certain love Yeah, to be hurt in love (oh to be hurt in love yeah thats certain love) Oh darling, that's certain love As I lay on the outside of my own mind Yeah, it's cold tonight Yeah, the feeling is no good Yeah, the feels not right So i'll just hold on tight I hear the strangest sounds Falling down these holes in the ground I can't think Held back tears, but I won't blink As I stand on the brink Oh, to be hurt in love To be hurt in love Well darling, that's certain love Yeah to be hurt in love Oh darling, that's certain love
