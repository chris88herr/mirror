Whoa I look out at the blue room Well yeah So exhausted by you Oh these nights just get cold Nothing is golden at your shoulder Not now I go to a little place Right outside my mind now Oh it's alright oh I go to a little palace outside my mind Oh it's alright And I am dancing all night Ooooh ahhh You look me straight in my eyes Say that you don't recognize me no more Rueful once I got away It's sure now I go to a little place Right outside my mind Oh it's alright oh I go to a little palace outside my mind Oh its alright And I am dancing all night Ooooh ahhh
