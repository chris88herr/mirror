To the moon We could laugh all day 'Cause there we'd be free From hurt and pain Just you and me, babe Ooh, ooh, ooh  Well, I wanna love you, baby I wanna treat you right Go tell me everything Is gon' be alright And if you can see That I'm on my knees And it's so So clear  Baby, where'd you wanna go? Darlin', whatever you say Got enough fuel in my rocket To take us far away, oh Well, have you ever imagined What it's like on the rings of Saturn? On a clear afternoon On the side of the moon Holding hands with you With you  I'ma love you baby I wanna treat you right Tell me everything Is gon' be alright And if you can see That I'm on my knees And it's so So clear
