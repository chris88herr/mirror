 Baby I could fall into your mind forever Maybe we could fall into our time together  Baby I was crazy before It could have be better Made a world somewhere in my head Bet I could feel the same warmth that I felt when you were flying with me  Baby I could fall into your mind forever Maybe we could fall into our time together  Baby I could fall into your mind forever Maybe we could fall in our time together
