 Found suburbia in someone else's eyes Tried to recreate it for myself Gone too far obscure My idea of passing time Try to put the sky on my own walls  Oh I feel like I've been too many places At once I thought you meant it when you said I was patient Oh i want you to know I'll wait forever for time to reappear and replace this interference  Ask myself does it need to go away Do you think that you should stay Or just look the other way Ask yourself is it time to reapply Your sense of getting high Won't you look into my eyes?  Oh I feel like I've been too many places At once I thought you meant it when you said I was patient Oh I want you to know I'll wait forever for time to reappear and replace this interference  Found a compromise in someone else's life It was overrated in itself Found the truth in lies in silken knots she ties 'Bout to come apart at anytime  Oh I feel like I've been too many places At once I thought you meant it when you said I was patient Oh I want you to know I'll wait forever for time to reappear and replace this interference  Ask myself does it need to go away Do you think that you should stay Or just look the other way Ask yourself is it time to reapply Your sense of getting high Won't you look into my eyes?  Hide your worries now Write your story now Cease your glory now Oh, Hide your worries now Write your story now Cease your glory now
