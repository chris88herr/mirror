 Take me up with you My skin's orange tinted blue Float through time with you Sunset meant for two, yeah  Gone too far with you I fear Cover up my eyes and steer Tell me how the sunset feels Call out colours don't conceal  Save my soul oh so many times Ash and smoke covered up in times Take the smoke down, enjoy the sky   Got so lost in time I found (climbed through time and time again)  rolling clouds (rolling through these rolling clouds) You appear like summer haze  felt long by this crippled space  Take me down with you oh oh (Take me down with you) Hellfire's hot enough for two (hot enough for two oh oh) Frozen time with you oh oh Summertime's  feel new (ooo oh oh)  Save my soul oh so many times Ash and smoke covered up in times Take the smoke down, enjoy the sky   Save my soul oh so many times (oh so many times) Ash and smoke covered up in times (covered up in times) Take the smoke down, enjoy the sky (and enjoy the sky)
