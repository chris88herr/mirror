 Said you won't trust nobody Gonna plan it alone Need a body to hold Night aglow and moon so bloody This place is feeling alive Time is frozen so right  Take me out of my own head I got these visions of you Smiling down at me and said With a shimmer of something new  "Baby, you restore my fallen pride Save me, from the chaos in my mind"  Emotions bruised and bloody Smiling by the fireside Sorry, not so warm inside Flying nearby 140 Summer winds will swallow you Make you feel like nothingâ€™s true  Take me out of my own head I got these visions of you Smiling down at me and said With a shimmer of something new  "Baby, you restore my fallen pride Save me, from the chaos in my mind"  Tell me something on your heart That'll change my state of mind Lately love don't feel so right With worries and a fight Like feeling the ocean over your skin Like floating so weightless from within  Baby, you restore my fallen pride Save me, from the chaos in my mind
