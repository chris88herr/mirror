 Waiting for clouds to loosely form Quiet just street time  Lost alone Waiting to past drive through the storm You know Rain falls  in California You know Sun burns on your arms like Arizona I don't know you at all When darkness turns to blue Shouldn't give you my all There's nothing left to lose  rainfall Flooding the streets Tasting an ocean, here to stay We waited for one thing The city from the sea Wishing the sunset's here to stay I don't know you at all When darkness turns to blue Shouldn't give you my all There's nothing left to lose California You could wait Melting  California You can stay Run from   You could fade You could wait You could make it okay You could fade You could wait You could make it okay
