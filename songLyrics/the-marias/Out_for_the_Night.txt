 You say I can be colder It’s just all in my head I’ll decide when it’s over Can we try it again (Can we try it, I’m a lazy body) Carry me up in the darkness and I will find You by my side, you by my side, you by my side  I see, every time I look there’s more dust on the leaves I know you do, I know you do When I fall asleep you can take it from me (If you wanted the torture) If you’re following I’ll be out for the night Then you’ll have it that way  Take it from me, I know what you need It’s just a way for me not to breathe Everything else isn’t anything Trying to find out what’s happening  Maybe I’m a martyr, make myself suffer in everything Could be an obsession, suddenly a blessing if you wanted me  Take it from me, I know what you need It’s just a way for me not to breathe Everything else isn’t anything Trying to find out what’s happening  Maybe I’m a martyr, make myself suffer in everything But you didn’t run, no she didn’t run, no she didn’t want to be anything  I can be your shelter, baby I can be your sweet I can be your lover, beneath the sheets I can be your lover in the storm if you would let me Why won’t you let me be your lover?
