 Baby I care for you But don't let me in Maybe I'll lie To keep them away from you But don't let me in Don't let me die  'Cause only if I never believed You wanted to run naturally Then I wouldn't say a prayer for you Just to show you that I care for you I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know  Baby I care for you So don't make me go dancing alone I'll wait by the stairs for you Wrapped up in smoke Laughing alone  'Cause only if I ever believed I wanted to run naturally Then I wouldn't say a prayer for you Just to show you that I care for you I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know I know, I know, I know
