I can't wait for Christmas We'll be happier than we have I can't wait for Christmas We'll laugh and we'll dance and we’ll cry We've come this far With beating hearts We're the lucky ones My mockingbird I know it hurts But if only for today We've gotta love I can't wait for Christmas We'll be happier than we have I can't wait for Christmas We'll dance and we’ll laugh and we'll cry The mistletoe The morning snow We're the lucky ones My mama's arms They feel so far But if only for today We've gotta love Wе've come this far With beating hеarts We're the lucky ones My mockingbird I know it hurts But if only for the day We've gotta love
