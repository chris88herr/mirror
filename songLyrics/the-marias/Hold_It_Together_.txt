 I’ve got a river in my head I remember what you said to me Got me workin' endlessly Is it December all this time I remember what it meant to me Got me workin' endlessly  I got a feeling that I wanna slow down with you Nobody else will ever do I got a feeling that I wanna be there with you Nobody else will ever do Nobody else will ever do (Nobody else will ever do) Nobody else will ever do (Nobody else will ever do) Nobody else will ever do  Hold it together God, I wish I knew better Than to be alone like this Maybe I’m over it I’m a little like you Don’t pick up, I slide through And never be alone like this I’m so over it  I got a feeling that I wanna slow down with you Nobody else will ever do I got a feeling that I wanna be there with you Nobody else will ever do Nobody else will ever do (Nobody else will ever do) Nobody else will ever do (Nobody else will ever do) Nobody else will ever do (Ah)  What is happening to me inside my head, I don’t Know if i could be a remedy or antidote Want you to talk to me and see if I’m the only one Like I’m draining out the water from a water gun You caught me callin' a shrink, I didn’t think you’re better than me But you’re singing this song like you’re meant to be I don’t wanna bow down, are you following? Are you following me?  I got a feeling that I wanna slow down with you (What is happening to me inside my head, I don’t) (Know if i could be a remedy or antidote) Want you to talk to me and see if I’m the only one Nobody else will ever do (Like I’m draining out the water from a water gun) I got a feeling that I wanna be there with you (You caught me callin' a shrink, I didn’t think you’re better than me) But you’re singing this song like you’re meant to be I don’t wanna bow down, are you following? Are you following me?  Nobody else will ever do Nobody else will ever do (Ah)
