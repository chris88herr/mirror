 Hello, it's nice to see you again Did you miss me? We're meant to be friends But it feels like a century In my head  If I say something that comes out all wrong Please forgive me For feeling this strong Like it feels just like angels Hmmm in my head  But darling the truth is In darkness I'm ruthless I wanna scream your name Again and again  Maybe I Am tempted by all that I see You're nothing like me I'm circling the room In gold and French perfume  But darling the truth is In darkness I'm ruthless I wanna scream your name Again and again  Oh baby, I'm misunderstood And youâ€™re the only one who knows I could See it all in black and white Looking better by my side Oh baby I don't want to be The only one that's talking in my sleep I could be your lullaby Be my lover every night  Can we fly away? Can we fly away?  Cause darling the truth is In darkness I'm ruthless I wanna scream your name Again and again  Oh baby I don't want to be The only one that's talking in my sleep I could be your lullaby Be my lover every night
