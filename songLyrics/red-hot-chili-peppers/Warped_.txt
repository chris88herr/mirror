 My tendency For dependency Is offending me It's upending me I'm pretending see To be strong and free From my dependency It's warping me  So much love So rare to dare Afraid of Ever being there Take me home I need repair Take me please To anywhere  Descend All the way All the way Everyday Warped  Descended from Demented men Struggle with The art of Zen Please don't look Too close at me You might not like What you see  Descend All the way All the way Everyday Warped And scared Of Being There  Night craving Sends me crawling oh Beg for mercy Does it show A vacancy That's full of holes Hold me please I'm feeling cold  Descend All the way All the way Everyday Warped And scared Of Being There
