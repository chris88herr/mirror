When they say you should Kill for your country Kill for your country I've got three kids to feed A fine woman and a need to speed Far away from this Land and its promise I wave goodbye to you And the peace that I wish I knew Time to leave and go Kill for my country Kill for my country Put 'em down and hold your fire Command that world that we inspire Put 'em down and hold your fire Set 'em up with quick release This world of ours, the land of the frees Set 'em up with quick release Overshot and made a mess This world is cold and I'm under-dressed Overshot and made a mess We consume and we digest This world is born (alt: sold) on a dead man's chest We consume and we digest Mow 'em down, Mow 'em down Hold your fire, Hold your fire Mow 'em down, Mow 'em down Hold your fire, Hold your fire This is a message to you This is a table for two Mow 'em down, Mow 'em down Hold your fire, Hold your fire Mow 'em down, Mow 'em down Hold your fire, Hold your fire
