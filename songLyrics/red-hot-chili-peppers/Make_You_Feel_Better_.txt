 She's the one she's the only one She's got ripped back light Gonna make me come I say when I smile I'm a really smile I got dreams so wide like a country mile  I said now, I'll take it It's better for you Somehow we'll make it 'Cause that's what we do  Pick a star in the open sky I see you see me and that is why I Hop along to the cowboy beat When I feel your fire jump up to meet  I said now, I'll take it It's better for you Somehow we'll make it 'Cause that's what we do  Something out there where love is your only friend and We are the ones that will make you feel better and Someone to spare when love is the only end and We are the ones that will make you feel better Oh yeah!  In a world that has run amok I've got to set my sights just to get struck I walk away from the rank and file With a punched out mouth and a pack of style I say... she's the one she's the only one Make me search myself until I'm done... and Tell me now in a telegram Do the sea of stars make a diagram... and  Something out there where love is your only friend and We are the ones that will make you feel better and Someone to spare when love is the only end and We are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah Oh yeah hey hey Oh yeah  So alive I arrive on dust You can search my mind For the red on rust... I said Take me there and she really cares Lighten up for me goinna hear my prayers, I said  I said now, I'll take it It's better for you Somehow we'll make it 'Cause that's what we do  Something out there where love is your only friend and We are the ones that will make you feel better and Someone to spare when love is the only end and We are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah  We are the ones that will make you feel better We are the ones that will make you feel better We are the ones that will make you feel better and We are the ones that will make you feel better now
