 Magpies on fire Making love like little wolves out on the porch Can lead to medicine Oh well, I'm game for anything at all  Scarecrow's a liar Spins a yarn and no one ever checked it out To see if it was real Sold you the moon and now it's time to fall  All along it's like a bird Who's trapped alone inside your cage, love  What more do you want? How much more can you take? I love my mistakes I've been here before  All and all it's just the call Of something wild beyond your room There's a changing of the major chord Your minor threat will do, love  My gun misfired Shot myself instead I guess I always knew I'd be the one to lose That screen door slams Time to make a move Help me  What more do you want? How much more can you take? I love my mistakes I've been here before  All and all it's like a bird Who's trapped alone inside your cage, love A bird who's born to live at half your age, girl A bird who's never really had a say  What more do you want? How much more can you take? I love my mistakes I've been here before  Least of all she's like a bird Who's now been freed from someone's cage
