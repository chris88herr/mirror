 I should be on my way I really ought not stay Far too strong with the pinup on Hear my conscience - I'm gone! I should have let you know This boy was made to roam The band is who I'm married to And this is what God said to do I let my motor stray Forgive me where I play Sending my love to a Tennessee She got style now let's see I remember who To surrender to The captain of my ship is brave It's brothers hood on a Mother's Day  Do do do do do Do do do do do Do do do do do Do do do do do  I show enough I love you I show enough I do So just remember who you Who you surrender to  I'm off to wonderland Just in my second hand Life is short but ain't it grand I'm a way outside but in demand I'll take it on my chin Go back and forth again Find me on some telephone With a broken down voice and a shake-ed tone Do unto others who You would have do to you Ain't no way I'd ever trade That sparer life for this piece of shade Destined for battle zone Why's there no lesson known The lesson's not to wait for me Unless you got a taste for the bittersweet  Do do do do do Do do do do do Do do do do do Do do do do do  I show enough I love you I show enough I do So just remember who you Who you surrender to  Let your joy decide Let your joy decide Everything we do Everything we do Let your motor ride Let your motor ride Everything we do Ow, hit me!  Do do do do do Do do do do do Do do do do do Do do do do do  I show enough I love you I show enough I do So just remember who you Who you surrender to  We could have made it, my love We could have skated through So just remember who you Who you surrender to
