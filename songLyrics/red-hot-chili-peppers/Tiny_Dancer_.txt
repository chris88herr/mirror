Blue jean baby, L.A lady Seamstress for the band Pretty eyed, pirate smile You married the music man Ballerina, you must've seen her Dancing in the sand And now she's in me, always with me Tiny dancer in my hand Jesus freaks out in the street Handing tickets out for God Turning back she just laughs The boulevard ain't that bad Piano man he makes his stand In the auditorium Looking on she sings the songs The words she knows The tunes she hums But oh how real it feels Lying here with no one near Only you and you can hear me When I say softly, slowly Hold me closer tiny dancer Count the headlights on the highway Lay me down in sheets of linen You had a busy day today (repeat) Blue jean baby, L.A lady Seamstress for the band Pretty eyed, pirate smile You married the music man Ballerina, you must've seen her dancing in the sand And now she's in me, always with me Tiny dancer in my hand But oh how real it feels Lying here with no one near Only you and you can hear me When I say softly, slowly Repeat chorus
