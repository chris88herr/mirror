 Janey You are my Victorian machinery (Breathe yourself to life) Lady Your tender shape is bending like the scenery (Ride you like a bike)  You be the sail and baby I'll be the rudder We could make it all day until it turns into butter I saw your face A seminal pleasure, I will love you forever When I heeded your call and every heavy endeavor I'll keep your place, woah!  Janey Coming down the mountain like a buffalo (Seeds deep in your eyes) Crazy But then again, a girl could like it rough you know (Makes up for her size)  You be the sail and baby I'll be the rudder We could make it all day until it turns into butter I saw your face A seminal pleasure, I will feel you forever When I heeded your call and every heavy endeavor I'll keep your place  Be yourself When I saw you You be the shack And baby I'll be the desert There is nothing to lack When there is nothing to measure It's all, all space Woah!  You are my Victorian machinery (Nah nah nah nah nah) woo! Janey Make a fist and knock me off the moon again (Breathe yourself to life)  Lady Make me feel like I was born in June again (Ride me like a bike) Crazy Sing along just like they do in Budapest (Hot moon on the rise)  You be the shack And baby I'll be the desert There is nothing to lack When there is nothing to measure It's all our space
