 And if I had a clue I'd know exactly what to do If I were the wiser of the two And if I saw it all so clear I'd write it down and bend your ear If I were the clearer of the two We could take a walk into the Canyons of 5th avenue Sing and dance... Just to name a few  All I do All I do  And if I heard the angels sing I'd sing it back to you and bring Sound of heaven ringing just for you And if I saw the sun fall down I'd pick it up and make a crown One that was a perfect fit for you We could take a walk Into the apple orchard by the school We could make a little residue We could find a place to stay A secret little hideaway Spend a little time inside of you  All I do All I do  All eyes All eyes All eyes on you  All I do All I do All I do All I do
