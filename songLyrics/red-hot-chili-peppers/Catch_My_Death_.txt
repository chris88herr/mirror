 Death Let me catch my breath Let me see what's left Let me see what's true Do I really want to Run from my depths? Will I have regrets? Will I ever find you? Will I ever find the words That give me motive to express?  Bread Will I go unfed? Will I be that fool who rushes on in To where angels fear to tread? Was it me who bled On the new death bed And there is no fear When you're leaning on love Those grateful dead  Someone like you To research the meaning of love Someone, I do To be there when push comes to shove I know that you know The ending numbers  Chess Let me play my best When I do regress Let it all unwind 'Cause we're never confined To the board unless There's a second guess Look into the sky Where we all comply With something higher than the Rest my love, sail through  Someone like you To research the meaning of love Someone, I do To be there when push comes to shove I know that you know The ending, the must Someone like you  Sky all around Fell to the ground Now I'm a child Stayed for a while  Flesh Is it meaningless? But we all protest To the last request Is there anything you Could now suggest? Did I do my best? Did I leave it better? Even though we look to be Just mildly obsessed with you Sail through  Someone like you To research the meaning of love Someone, I do To be there when push comes to shove I know that you know The ending, the must  Someone like you To be there
