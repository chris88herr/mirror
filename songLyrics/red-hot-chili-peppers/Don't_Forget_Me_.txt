 I'm an ocean in your bedroom Make you feel warm, make you want to re-assume Now we know it all for sure I'm a dance hall dirty breakbeat Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet  Not alone, I'll be there Tell me when you want to go  I'm a meth lab, first rehab Take it all off and step inside the running cab There's a love that knows the way I'm the rainbow in your jail cell All the memories of everything you've ever smelled  Not alone, I'll be there Tell me when you want to go (Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend)  (Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend) Don't forget me, I can't hide it Come again get me excited  I'm an inbred and a pothead Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed Now we know it all for sure I could show you to the free field Overcome and more will always be revealed  Not alone, I'll be there Tell me when you want to go (Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend)  (Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend) Don't forget me, I can't hide it Come again make me excited (Sideways fallin', more will be revealed, my friend) Don't forget me, I can't hide it Thereâ€™s a match, now let me light it   I'm the bloodstain on your shirt sleeve Coming down and more are coming to believe Now we know it all for sure Make the hair stand up on your arm Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm  Not alone, I'll be there Tell me when you want to go I'll be there, tell me when you want to go Come on in and tell me when you want to go More will be revealed, my friend
