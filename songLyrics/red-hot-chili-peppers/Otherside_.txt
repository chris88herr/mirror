 How long, how long Will I slide? Well separate my side I don’t I don’t believe it’s bad Slittin' my throat It’s all I ever  I heard your voice through a photograph I thought it up And brought up the past Once you know you can never go back  I gotta take it on the otherside  Well centuries are what it meant to me A cemetery where I marry the sea The stranger things that never change my mind  I gotta take it on the otherside Take it on the otherside Take it on Take it on  How long, how long Will I slide? A-separate my side I don’t I don’t believe it’s bad A-slittin' my throat It’s all I ever  Pour my life into a paper cup The ashtray's full And I’m spillin' my guts She want to know Am I still a slut?  I gotta take it on the otherside  A scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed A candidate for my soul mate bled Mmm-push the trigger And I pull the thread  I gotta to take it on the otherside Take it on the otherside Take it on Take it on  How long, how long Will I slide? Separate my side I don’t I don’t believe it’s bad A-slittin' my throat It’s all I ever  2:51 - 3:06  Turn me on Take me for a hard ride Burn me out Leave me on the otherside I yell and tell it that it’s not my friend I tear it down, I tear it down And then it’s born again  3:20 - 3:28  How long, how long Will I slide? Separate my side I don’t I don’t believe it’s bad A-slittin' my throat It’s all I ever had  (How long) I don’t I don’t believe it’s sad A-slittin' my throat It’s all I ever
