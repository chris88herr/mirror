 I was walking through a courtyard Without shoes and Without regard Automatic catacombs Take me where I wanna go  All around All in phases It astounds And amazes Built to last and known to roam Touch me on my chromosome  One time Fascinated by the face of time One time I got it to give and now we're going to make some time  Ultra-fine and altruistic Can I spy into the mystic System's down for infiltration Open mind free of frustration  I was driving To a safe place And arriving As I retraced Yell into a telescope Aim it at the star of hope  One time Fascinated by the face of time One time I got it to give and now we're going to make some time  All over the young girl The smell of blood and thunder I'm connected by the lightning rod Giving the beauty to it Heaven knows how well I know you  Ultra-fine and altruistic Can I spy into the mystic System's down for infiltration Open mind free of frustration  All around All in phases It astounds And amazes Built to last and known to roam Touch me on my chromosome  One time Fascinated by the face of time One time I got it to give and now we're going to make some time  All over the young girl The smell of blood and thunder I'm connected by the lightning rod Giving the beauty to it Heaven knows how well I know you  Time
