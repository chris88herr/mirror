 Each time we have a quarrel It almost breaks my heart Because I am so afraid That we will have to part Each night I ask the stars up above  Why must I be a teenager in love?  One day I feel so happy Next day I feel so sad I guess I'll learn to take The good with the bad Each night I ask the stars up above  Why must I be a teenager in love?  I cry a tear For nobody but you I'll be your lonely one if you should say we are through Well if you want to make me cry That won't be so hard to do If you should say good bye I still go on loving you Each night I ask the stars up above  Why must I be a teenager in love?  I cry a tear For nobody but you I'll be your lonely one if you should say we are through Well if you want to make me cry That won't be so hard to do If you should say good bye I still go on loving you Each night I ask the stars up above  Why must I be a teenager in love? Why must I be a teenager in love? Why must I be a teenager in love? Why must I be a teenager in love? Why must I be a teenager in love? Why must I be a teenager in love? Why must I be a teenager in love?
