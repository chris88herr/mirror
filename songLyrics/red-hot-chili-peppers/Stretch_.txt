 Stretching out your tightness Good enough to make you grow We are all in favor of this motion Stretching out your tightness Time to open up your hole When it rains, I let myself get wet I have always wanted to Give something to my brother Proposing to expose your head Just something that is like no other  I'll stretch you out I'll stretch you out, my friend I'll stretch you out  The juice that flows from intuition Is my liquid fare We are all in favor of the open end Three pounds of love and knowledge Are expanding in my skull Truth be told, we let the good times roll I have always needed to Receive it and believe it And it's making and creating love Tender titillation   I'm a fish and I can swim all day I can swim in so many ways Make it up as I go along That way it is never wrong I'm a bird and I can fly away I can shift in so many shapes Make it up as I go along That way it is never wrong Owwwwwwww....  There's a glowing up around the moon It is showing We want to play in the water that is flowing  Very legendary Extra planetary fairy Varied truths, she's making just for you Yes I have always wanted to Give something to the stranger M-m-m-moving to improve the groove A mental transformation
