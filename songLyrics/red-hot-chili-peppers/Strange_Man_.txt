 All of my love and most of my fears Been coming on strong for most of my Years add up and end up in a song  Cellophane tweeds and revenue streams Are blocking my shots and killin' my Dreams that showed me how to be the cause Ooh ahh, yella Ooh ahh, hey, ah, what now?  It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's right It's a long time for me, I see She wants to belong and I want to be free Excommunicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh, yeah  All of my friends and enemies They were part of this dance that put me right Here we go, so glad I got this chance  Better known plans and lesser known schemes Were all about love and less about Me, I'd have to say she wore the pants That's, oh!  It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's right It's a long time, for me, u-huh She wants to belong and I want to be free Excommunicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee   It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's right It's a long time, for me, let's see She wants to belong and I want to be free Ex-communicated 'cause there ain't no guarantee  It's the lifetime of a strange man, that's right It's a long time, for me, uh uh She wants to be rich and I want to be free Keep your plans elastic 'cause there ain't no guarantee
