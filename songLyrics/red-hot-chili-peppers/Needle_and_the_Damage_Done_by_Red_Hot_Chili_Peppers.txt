I caught you knockin' At my cellar door I love you, baby Can I have some more Ooh, ooh, the damage done I hit the city and I lost my band I watched the needle Take another man Gone, gone, the damage done I sing the song Because I love the man I know that some Of you don't understand Milk-blood To keep from running out I've seen the needle And the damage done A little part of it in everyone But every junkie's Like a settin' sun --- --- .
