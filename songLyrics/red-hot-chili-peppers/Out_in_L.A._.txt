 We're all a bunch of brothers living in a cool way Along with six million others in this place called LA  LA is the place, sets my mind ablaze For me, it's a race through a cotton-picking maze The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks Well sure, it's got some chumps, but I still get my kicks My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick Alike dump on a thumb Pop hump, hump, hump, pop out The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be Because I'm shooting for the top, and my best friend's a Flea Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls could pop But he never met the tree, so he never bebopped, hop out  Antoine the Swan, from the pretty fish pond Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong Wore a cold paisley jacket and a hella fine ass In between his legs was a sweet young lass Threw a hundred women up against the wall And he swore to fear that he'd love them all By the time he got to ninety-nine, he had to stop 'Cause that's when he thought that he heard a fop  Last night and the night before I heard a fop outside, then I Came indoors! Rock out!  Now that I told ya somethin' about the Flea Somethin' 'bout the Tree A little somethin' 'bout me I can't leave you hanging 'bout my man Sherm Zee He swings the ying, he bangs the yang And now, it's time to hear him do his thang You better be burnin' Sherman!  We're all a bunch of brothers living in a cool way Along with six million others in this place called LA Step out!
