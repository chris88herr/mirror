 I got more love than anything else But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health Struck by the notion that it just might be A method to the madness that I cannot see  Suffering for the freedom of a roughed up soul Forty-two years young is a little bit old Boy named Sue sing a Tennessee tune Got buffalo love living on the moon  Save this lady for me  Call me Alabama, I'm a Seminole prize Got Time Square hair and a bedroom eyes Keystone cops and the billy bob chops Gonna scare my kids gonna share my crops  Vampire blood and a baseball glove Just a little bit of what the girl is made of National crash into the big lampoon With a creature coming up from the black lagoon  Save this lady for me  Losing ground true sounds of levity The forest of the north might hold the key  Rocking to the rhythm of a ragtime band Black flag wave on on my truck my man Blasting for jones and the great unknowns Got cheap cologne seventy-six trombones  Looking for the lady that won't be afraid When heaven needs a hammer gotta get things made I got more love than anything else But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health  Save this lady for me
